# New Direction — working notes

This is the initiation document for the new game. It is a **container for
Ayr's ideas**, written down as she has them, in her words. Nothing here is
invented or proposed by Claude unless it is explicitly marked as such.

---

## Status

Brainstorming. Twenty opening ideas captured 2026-08-24. Almost nothing is
settled yet — the Ideas section is the record of intent, not a spec.

---

## Where this sits

| | |
|---|---|
| Branch | `wildlands-next` |
| Branched from | `main` at `17f3bad` |
| Date started | 2026-08-24 |
| Tag of the pre-branch state | `v1-safari-saga` |

**`main` is untouched and stays the live game.** GitHub Pages deploys from
`main` only, so <https://ayrethyme-creator.github.io/wildlands/> keeps serving
Safari Saga exactly as it is now, and it can still be updated any time by
switching back to `main` and pushing. Work on this branch is invisible to it.

Eric also pushes to `main`. That is another reason the new direction lives on
its own branch — his work and this work cannot collide until somebody
deliberately merges them.

### What this branch inherits

Everything Safari Saga currently is, at `17f3bad`: 1000 species with finished
art, 100 mythics, the map/battle/dex/save systems, seventeen conservation
investigations, clue gating and corridor placement.

Note that idea 13 removes gyms, battles and trainers, which is a large part of
what is inherited. The art, the species data, the dex and the investigations
survive that; the battle system largely does not. Nothing has to be deleted
early — the old game is safe on `main` regardless.

## Ideas

*Ayr's, 2026-08-24, in her words. Grouped by subject for reading, not
reordered by priority and not filtered.*

### The world

**1. Seed generated game.**

**5.** A seed generated world but **similar to the way Diablo does it: still
maintains themes for the different regions** ie: savanna, ocean, jungle etc.

**9.** Day and night cycles, and seasons.

**12. UNDECIDED —** "I don't know if I want to use the real world map or a
made up world yet."

### Who you are

**2. Three main character choices, each a different "career" with unique
abilities:** photographer, researcher, tour guide.

**3.** The three career options **still allow the ability to customize your
avatar**.

### Life stages

**6.** Life stages: **start as a kid, then a teen, young adult, adult with
skills, adult with power money and influence, elder who mentors others.**

**7.** The **kid stage is the basic tutorial**, and lays out some story and
personality. **The teen stage is where you choose your career path**, plus a
tutorial for the abilities of that specific choice. "and maybe you chose
friends that will help you throughout the game."

**8. The real game starts at young adult.**

### Animals and befriending

**9.** You still have the ability to **befriend all 1000 of the animals**, but
it will **depend heavily on what area you're in**.

**10.** "I need to design the **befriend encounter mechanic way different**
from the current game."

**19.** Some animals **can't** come to the facilities (like great white
sharks), but instead there are **areas in the biome where you can interact
with them in the wild almost guaranteed** — swimming with sharks and whales,
visiting beaver ponds, fields where moose graze.

### Conflict, story and progression

**11.** Keep the concept of **solving problems the locals are having, and
problems industries are causing.**

**13. No gyms, no battles, no trainers.** Maybe the "trainer battles" are
instead **personal encounters with people you have to convince**, using info
you gather from the field and research — **the player actually reading the
info.**

**16.** The "gym battles" — the way you advance the story — is by going to
**certain sections of each biome that have a fixed plot** with characters and
goals.

**17.** These goals and challenges are **the furthering of your career by
making an actual difference for the animals.**

### Facilities

**18.** Some goals are **building facilities. Each biome will have a facility
you build**, based on **real life zoos and wildlife recovery centers.** It is
like a **mini game**: you **hire people, choose the animals from that biome
you've befriended, and name them.**

- **Not all animals will do well in captivity. Some will be catch and
  release.**
- They all have **difficulty levels that can change** as you gather more info
  from the field and from passing tests in the guide.

### Learning

**14. Read aloud option** for the info in the guide.

**15. Tests you can take from the guide** to practice your knowledge.

### Influences

**4.** Pulling ideas from: **Pokémon** obviously, but also **Pokémon Snap,
Stardew Valley, Diablo, and Minecraft.**

### Bar for quality

**20.** "Music, art, and game play will be **professional level**. This game
may take years, and **I'm ok with that**. I do however want to keep it
**relevant and fun, and competitive to what's on the market**."

## Questions to come back to

*Raised by the ideas above, noted so they do not interrupt brainstorming.
None of these are objections — several are just "which way do you want it".*

1. **Real world map or invented world (idea 12).** Flagged as undecided by
   Ayr. It affects a lot downstream — species placement, the biome list, and
   whether region names are real places.
2. **What replaces the battle system (idea 13).** Removing gyms, battles and
   trainers takes out the main progression spine of the current game. Ideas
   16 and 17 name the replacement (fixed-plot biome sections, career
   advancement) — the question is what the moment-to-moment verbs are.
3. **What "befriend" actually is (idea 10).** Explicitly Ayr's to design.
   Everything about pacing and the 1000-species goal hangs off it.
4. **How seeded generation and fixed plots coexist (ideas 1, 5, 16).** The
   world is procedural but story sections are authored and fixed. Needs a
   rule for how authored content is placed into a generated world.
5. **How the six life stages are paced (ideas 6, 7, 8).** Kid and teen are
   tutorials, the game starts at young adult — so how long are the four adult
   stages, and what moves you between them?
6. **Do the three careers diverge or converge (idea 2)?** Different abilities
   could mean three different playthroughs, or one game seen from three
   angles.
7. **Scope and platform against the quality bar (idea 20).** "Professional
   level" music and art, and competitive with the market, is a different
   proposition from a browser game built from concatenated JSX. Worth an
   honest conversation about target platform before much is built.

## Decisions

*Only things actually settled. Dated, so a later change of mind reads as a
change rather than a contradiction.*

- **2026-08-24** — The new game is a branch of the current one, not a rewrite
  in place or a separate repo. The current game stays playable and stays
  updatable.
- **2026-08-24** — No gyms, no battles, no trainers (idea 13).
- **2026-08-24** — Three careers: photographer, researcher, tour guide (idea
  2), with avatar customization retained regardless of career (idea 3).
- **2026-08-24** — Six life stages, real play beginning at young adult (ideas
  6, 8).
- **2026-08-24** — Seeded world generation with themed regions, Diablo-style
  (ideas 1, 5).
- **2026-08-24** — All 1000 species remain befriendable (idea 9).
- **2026-08-24** — Long timeline is acceptable; quality bar is professional
  and market-competitive (idea 20).

## Practical notes

**Switching between the two games:**

```bash
git checkout main            # the live Safari Saga - still deployable
git checkout wildlands-next  # this, the new direction
```

**Playing this branch.** GitHub Pages only serves `main`, so this branch is
not live anywhere yet. To play it locally:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000   # then open http://localhost:8000
```

If the new direction gets far enough to want its own shareable link, that is
a separate decision — a second deployment target or a separate repo — and it
is not needed to start.
